Redirects a logged in user to the homepage instead of the Dashboard.

== Description ==
After a user has logged in, the user will be redirected to the homepage
instead of the Dashboard when this plugin is activated. The plugin has no
settings and should work perfectly fine with Multisite installations
(the plugin will use the blog url and _not_ the main site url).

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `redirect2homepage` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Done!

== Notes ==
