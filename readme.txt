Redirects a logged in user to the homepage instead of the Dashboard.

== Description ==
After a user has logged in, the user will be redirected to the homepage
instead of the Dashboard when this plugin is activated. The plugin has no
settings and should work perfectly fine with Multisite installations
(the plugin will use the blog url and _not_ the main site url).

3. Done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin actively being developed? =
Yes and no. Let me explain: 
I consider this plugin to be feature complete and unless bugs are found there will be no development on this plugin. In other words this plugin is in maintenance mode and will be maintained for the foreseeable future. 
Due to other obligations I'm not always able to keep up with WordPress version's and updating this readme's 'Tested up to' version number. 
However, unless WordPress significantly changes the way the login_redirect filter works it should work perfectly fine even though the 'Tested up to' might be of a lower version number. 
As always, when in doubt, test it :) (and when it does give you issues, feel free to leave a comment).
